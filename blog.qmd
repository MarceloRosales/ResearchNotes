This file is the "main page" or "landing page" for the blogs.

All subsequent blog files need to be saved in the `/posts` folder.The yml code in this file will direct to the assign folder and the way is displayed as well.ã€€ In other words, the posts listing for this page comes from the contents in the `/posts` folder ..."contents: posts"

Q: For organization convenience... Can I place this landing page file directly into the posts folder? No, the posts will be displayed in this page.
