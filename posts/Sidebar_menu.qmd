## Adding a Sidebar

To Create a side bar for a specific page within a main drop-down menu:

::: callout-important
If there is only one sidebar id, the sidebar will be displayed in all the pages and menus regardless of their location.

To Create a sidebar for a specific page 2 or more sidebar id's are required
:::

1.  In the \_quarto.yml file create the drop-down menu.

    ``` yaml
    website:
      navbar:

        left:
          - text: "Home"
          - text: "dropdown" # drop-down menu name   
            menu: 
              - text: "Section1_name"
                href: files/dropdown/section1_name/landing_page1.qmd 
              - text: "Section2_name"
                href: files/dropdown/section2_name/landing_page2.qmd # most be named index.qmd? or any name ok?
    ```

2.  In the \_quarto.yml file create the sidebar and id for the page.

    1.  If only one sidebar id, then sidebar will be displayed in all pages.

    2.  If 2 or more sidebar id's, then it will be displayed only in the specified page.

    ``` yaml
      sidebar:
        - id: section1_name 
          title: "Get Started with the docs"
          style: "floating"
          collapse-level: 3
          align: left
          contents:  
            - text: "Section Intro"
              href: files/dropdown/section1_name/landing_page1.qmd  
            - text: "Doc 1"
              href: files/dropdown/section1_name/doc1.qmd  
            - text: "Doc 2"
              href: files/dropdown/Section1_name/doc02.qmd

        - id: section2_name 
          title: "Get Started with the docs"
          style: "floating"
          collapse-level: 3
          align: left
          contents:  
            - text: "Section Intro"
              href: files/dropdown/section2_name/landing_page2.qmd  
            - text: "Doc 1"
              href: files/dropdown/section2_name/doc1.qmd  
            - text: "Doc 2"
              href: files/dropdown/Section2_name/doc02.qmd
    ```

3.  full \_quarto.yml code

    ``` yaml
    website:
      navbar:

        left:
          - text: "Home"
          
          - text: "dropdown" # drop-down menu name   
            menu: 
              - text: "Section1_name"
                href: files/dropdown/section1_name/landing_page1.qmd 
              - text: "Section2_name"
                href: files/dropdown/section2_name/landing_page2.qmd # most be named index.qmd? or any name ok?

      sidebar:
        - id: section1_name 
          title: "Get Started with the docs"
          style: "floating"
          collapse-level: 3
          align: left
          contents:  
            - text: "Section Intro"
              href: files/dropdown/section1_name/landing_page1.qmd  
            - text: "Doc 1"
              href: files/dropdown/section1_name/doc1.qmd  
            - text: "Doc 2"
              href: files/dropdown/Section1_name/doc02.qmd

        - id: section2_name 
          title: "Get Started with the docs"
          style: "floating"
          collapse-level: 3
          align: left
          contents:  
            - text: "Section Intro"
              href: files/dropdown/section2_name/landing_page2.qmd  
            - text: "Doc 1"
              href: files/dropdown/section2_name/doc1.qmd  
            - text: "Doc 2"
              href: files/dropdown/Section2_name/doc02.qmd #.. etc

    ``` bash
    mkdir files/dropdown/Section_name/
    ```

5.  Create the landing page?

    ``` yaml
